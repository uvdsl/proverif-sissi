# AnonVCs - Anonymous SISSI Protocol

In this directory, you find the files for the protocol based on Anonymous Credentials that still adhere to the VC data model recommendation by the W3C.

- Option A: Never reveal the plain VC, s.t. only you can derive new proof of knowledge of the signature.
- Option B: Some identifier homomorphy, to still present the derived credential properly having a verifiable presentation.
